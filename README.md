# ZippingServiceProject

This is zipping service project which provides you with information about blocked zip code where you cannot send the items. 
For Example Let's say we cannot deliver packages to some zip codes so this service will take the zip codes(as series) and will return you the blocked zip code area on which you cannot send items.

I have used spring boot framework for this service.
